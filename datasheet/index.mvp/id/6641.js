The DSSHA1 can compute SHA-1 message authentication codes (MACs) for use with Maxim SHA-1 devices, such as the DS1963S, DS1961S, DS28E10, DS28E02, DS2460, DS28CN01, and DS28E01-100. The device can output the 20-byte MAC result from registers required for comparison against SHA-1 slave devices. When incorporated into a design, DSSHA1 also provides an offloading function, relieving a microcontroller of performing the SHA-1 computation.",    "datasheetURL":"http://datasheets.maxim-ic.com/en/ds/DSSHA1.pdf",	"diagram":"../datasheet/index.mvp/id/diagrams/6641.gif",    "key_f":[		"SHA-1 Computations Within 670 Clock Cycles (13.4 s at a Typical Frequency of 50MHz)",		"Area Estimate is 102,256 m? in TSMC CL018G (0.18 m Generic Process)",		"Dedicated Hardware-Accelerated SHA-1 Engine for Generating MACs",		"64-Byte RAM for Message Input",		"Five 32-Bit Registers to Read the MAC Result",		"Available in Synthesizable Verilog",		"Made as a Low-Level Module to be Instantiated by a Top-Level Module",		"Includes Test Bench"    ],    "app": [        "Identification and authentication of consumables",        "Printer Cartridge",        "Reference Design License Management",        "Secure Feature Control of Systems",        "Sensor/Accessory Authentication and Calibration",        "System Intellectual Property Protection"           ]			}
