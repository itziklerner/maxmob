    "descr":"The DS28E01PMOD provides the necessary hardware to interface a DS28E01-100 1Kb protected 1-Wire EEPROM with a SHA-1 engine to a Xilinx Spartan-6 LX16 Evaluation Kit made by Avnet. By using the DS28E01PMOD and the PicoBlaze SHA-1 Authentication Design for the Xilinx Spartan-6 LX16 Evaluation Kit, a secure SHA-1 challenge-and-response authentication can be implemented. The PicoBlaze SHA-1 Authentication Design is based upon the Xilinx XAPP780 application note, FPGA IFF Copy Protection Using Dallas Semiconductor/Maxim DS2432 Secure EEPROMs.",
